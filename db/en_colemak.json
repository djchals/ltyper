"she explained it all to me. it was terribly pathetic. but i was not 
moved a bit. i thought her shallow. then something happened that 
made me afraid. i cant tell you what it was, but it was awful. i said 
i would go back to her. i felt i had done wrong. and now she is dead. my
god my god harry, what shall i do you dont know the danger i am in",

"Try it again. Fail again. Fail better.
It's in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.
Always seek out the seed of triumph in every adversity.
Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds.
The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda.",

"You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear.
Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.
Light tomorrow with today!
You cannot have negative mind and pretend that you'll be successful
I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse",

"Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a 
little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir vigorously to coat the grains or,
if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before
breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter
over the spring onion to serve.",

"Fry the sliced sausages until browned, then transfer to a warm oven. 
Use the same pan to melt the butter and add the sliced fennel and fennel
seeds. Fry until the fennel softens, then add the crushed garlic clove 
and cook for 1 min more.",

"Heat the oil in a non/stick pan. Fry the sweet potato for 2/3 mins each
side until just cooked, then season and set aside to cool. When the rice
is cool, divide between two small bowls (or lunch boxes) and level the surface.
Halve the prawns lengthways, then arrange on top of the rice along with the rest
of the toppings. To serve, squeeze over some spicy mayo in a zigzag and sprinkle
over some sesame seeds, if you like.",

"Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt until the sugar
has dissolved. Stir the vinegar mixture into the cooked rice, then gently
move the rice around to let out some steam. The rice should be sticky rather
than wet when cooled.",

"Put the rice and quinoa in a pan. Add 320ml water, bring to the boil, cover
with a lid and turn the heat down as low as it will go. Cook for 12/15 mins,
or following pack instructions (brown sushi rice will need longer), by which
time all the water should have been absorbed.
Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt until the sugar
has dissolved."
