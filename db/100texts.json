    ["I never saw a more striking coincidence. If Wallace had my 
M.S. sketch written out in 1842 he could not have made a better 
short abstract! Even his terms now stand as Heads of my Chapters,
he wrote to Lyell.",

"To characterize Darwin's comments to Lyell and Hooker as
angst-riddenis too kind. Darwin's tone sounded as if his whole life
had been turned upside down by Wallace's essay. Why was Darwin
so disturbed? The answer reveals something of Darwin's character-
it is not possible to be definitive because Darwin was so emotional.",

"In the year 1108 b.c., Brutus, a descendant of neas,who was
the son of Venus, came to England with his companions, after
the taking of Troy, and founded the City of Troynovant, which
is now called London. After a thousand years, during which the
City grew and flourished exceedingly, one Lud became its king.
He built walls and towers, and, among other things.",

"Let us consider this question as regards London. Look at the map
called 'Roman London' (p. 15). You will there see flowing into the
river Thames two little streams, one called Walbrook, and the other
called the Fleet River. You will see a steep slope, or cliff,
indicated along the river side.",

"the Victorian era is succeeded or some might say, overthrown
â€“ by the Modern. But modernism is not capacious enough to encompass
the various kinds of literary art that emerged in Britain following
World War II, the postmodern and the postcolonial, for example. We 
could follow the lead of recent scholars.",

"The river Thames ran through this marsh. It was then much broader
than at present, because there were no banks or quays to keep it 
within limits: at high tide it overflowed the whole of the marsh and 
lay in an immense lake, bounded on the north by this low cliff of 
clay and on the south by the rising ground of what we now call the 
Surrey Hills, which begin between Kennington and Clapham.",

"Annie, in 1851, was one of the most traumatic events of his life.
His marriage, the move to the countryside, and the friends he made
are all reminders of the ordinariness of Darwin. It was Darwin who 
wrote, when thinking about his future.",

"particularly in South America: the fossils he had discovered, the 
geographical distribution of closely related animals, and the slight
differences between species on each island of the Galapagos. What was
the significance of these facts? The facts could only be explained on
the supposition that species gradually became modified.",

"Victorian and Twentieth-Century Literature Given the myriad changes 
to British culture and society in the past 200 years,what then might
serve as a common narrative frame for this volume of essays? One
binding premise of this diverse collection is not surprisingly change
itself. I do notmean any old change, but irreversible.",

"OCD can develop in both adults and children, although it normally 
emerges before a person turns 30. Boys usually show their first 
symptoms at a younger age than girls, so OCD is twice as common 
in boy children than in girls. In adults the number of men and 
women with OCD is equal.",

"The Romans, when they resolved to settle in England, established 
themselves on the opposite hillock, the eastern bank of the
Walbrook. The situation was not so strong as that of the British 
town, because it was protected by cliff and river on two sides 
only instead of three. But the Romans depended on their walls and 
their arms rather than the position of their town.",

"This evening it's raining, as never before; and I don't want
to go on living, heart.This evening is sweet. Why shouldn't it
be? It is dressed in grace and suffering; it is dressed as a woman.",

"It is a wonderful place vast, strange, new and impossible to
describe. Its grandeur does not consist in one thing, but in 
the unique assemblage of all things. Whatever human industry has
created you find there, from the great compartments filled with 
railway engines and boilers, with mill machinery in full work, 
with splendid carriages of all kinds.",

"At the end of the battle,and the combatant dead, a man came unto 
him and said: 'Do not die, I love you so much! 'But the corpse
alas, kept on dying.Two men approached and repeated:' Do not leave 
us Be brave! Come back to life!' But the corpse, alas, kept on dying",

"The history of Roman London is meagre. Seventeen years after the
building of the Citadel, on the rebellion of Boadicea, the Roman
general Suetonius abandoned the place, as unable to defend it. All
those who remained were massacred by the insurgents. After this, 
so far as we know, for history is silent, there was peace in London
for 200 years. ",

"People with OCD feel compelled to do certain thing because their 
obsessive thoughts trigger intense anxiety. For example, someone
with OCD might feel a strong urge to check that they locked the 
door, over and over, because their fear of being robbed is 
overwhelming. Other times, people with OCD wash their hands
repetitively because they're terrfied about getting an infection.",

"Studying the great works of British literature in terms of their  
anxious imaginative engagement with violently changing times goes
against the grain of a powerful and tenacious and, in scare quotes,
Victorian imagining of the national past. This Whiggish belief held
that revolution and turmoil were the unhappy plight of the 
XXXIV Volume IV: Victorian and Twentieth-Century Literature",

"What will you be doing at this very hour, my sweet, Andean Rita
of the wild reed and the dusk berry;now that Byzantium smothers me, 
and that blood dozes, like insipid brandy, inside me.
She must be at the door staring at the cloud-lined sky.",

"But it is too easy to focus on these concerns because they fit so
well into a story of the outbreak of the 'war' between science and
religion. Without doubt, the delay in the completion of The Origin 
of Species was mainly due to the character of the man.",

"Needless to say, scholars today do not see the canon in quite this 
way. But there is at least one major assumption that many readers, 
including the contributors to this collection share with high minded
Victorian: they continue to view British literature as a crucial 
vehicle for establishing and negotiating the relevant sense of 
national identity",

"The fourth section records a nostalgic vision of the past, one that
contrasts with most of the nativistic poetry of the time, usually 
set in a golden age of unreachable and now-lost glory. Even though 
the modernista stereotypes and the love for affected images are
present.",

"Let us hear what history has to tell. Times full of trouble fell 
upon the country. Long before the Romans went away the Picts and 
Scots were pouring their wild hordes over the north and west, 
sometimes getting as far south as the Middlesex Forest, murdering 
and destroying. As early as the year 368, forty years before 
they left the country.",

"Many people have mild OCD 'symptoms', like wanting things to be 
organised or doubting whether they've locked the door. To be 
classified as OCD however, these symptoms need to be intense, 
distressing, and significantly interfere with a person's life.",

"We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a 
'new fellow,' not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant
carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every
one rose  as if just surprised at his work.",

"was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would 
support her in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for 
the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached 
herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing 
him incapable of generosity.",

"looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by braces,
He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.We began repeating 
the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as attentive as if at
a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow
and when at two o'clock the bell rang.",

"The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, 
felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the
farther knowledge of her character, which half a year's residence
in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration
of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former.",

"Twenty, a hundred, a thousand, half a million came toward him,
shouting: 'So much love, and nothing can be done against death!'
But the corpse, alas, kept on dying. Millions of people surrounded
him, with one common plea: 'Stay here, brother!'
But the corpse, alas, kept on dying",

"London, therefore, standing in its marshes had no means of providing
for itself. All the food for its great population was imported. It
was brought on pack asses along these roads. It came from the farms
and gardens of the country inland by means of these high roads
strong, broad, and splendid roads.",

"While the wave goes, while the wave comes, with what impunity is 
one dead. Only when the waters crash on the opposing borders and 
they fold and refold themselves, then you are transformed and, 
thinking you are dead, perceive the sixth string no longer yours. ",

"In the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his 
desk, arranged his small belongings, and carefully ruled his paper.
We saw him working conscientiously,looking up every word in the
dictionary, and taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the
willingness he showed, he had not to go down to the class below.",

"the postmodern and the postcolonial, for example. We could follow 
the lead of recent scholars and expand the modernist period beyond
the 'high' to include the 'late' and arguably the 'post' as well. 
But this conceptual as well as temporal expansion does not take 
in the vital British literature written from the 1970s onward",

"Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives 
of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who 
had died very rich; and some mighthave repressed it from motives
of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune 
depended on the will of his mother.",

"By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure,
I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the 
young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",

"Compose yourself, said Clerval, who observed my change of colour,
I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and
cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in
your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and
are uneasy at your long silence.",

"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",

"There was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly
put the poor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether 
to keep his cap in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on
his head. He sat down again and placed it on his knee.",

"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too
early in life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you
be less fortunate than your mother? In one circumstance only, 
my Marianne, may your destiny be different from her's! ",

"Between 1789 and 1848 Europe and America were flooded with British
experts,steam engines, cotton machinery and investments. There was 
no more industrially advanced nation on earth in the nineteenth
century. Why then do eminent Victorians figure so rarely as 
protagonists in sweeping overviews of modernity? ",

"in certain conscription scandals, and forced at this time to
leave the service, had taken advantage of his fine figure to
get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand francs that offered in
the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen in love
with his good looks.",

"dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has
already had one or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his 
favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. Now, dear 
Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip 
concerning the good people of Geneva.",

"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; 
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how
she was ever to get out again.",

"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid
my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, 
to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other
country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a 
warm sun and a garden of roses.",

"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early
in life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less 
fortunate than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne,
may your destiny be different from her's!",

"In this marsh were a few low islets, always above water save at 
very high tides. The memory of these islands is preserved in the
names ending with ea or ey, as Chelsea, Battersea, Bermondsey And
Westminster Abbey was built upon the Isle of Thorns or Thorney. 
The marsh, south of the river, remained a marsh, undrained and
neglected for many centuries.",

"half farm, half private house; and here, soured, eaten up with 
regrets, cursing his luck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself 
up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined
to live at peace.His wife had adored him once on a time.",

"enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence 
of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by 
that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of
him to do justice to his solid worth.",

"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and
Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors
of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key
was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.",

"mind until it was on a level with your own! A selfish pursuit had
cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed
and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few 
years ago,loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",

"them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in
short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion-the hope
of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence
or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am
by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments
when the extent of it seems doubtful.",

"This is not to say that the truly representative Victorians were 
closer to Baudelaire than to Carlyle in spirit. The chapters on 
nineteenth century literature, science, and culture in this volume
do not assume the Victorian period was a proto-modernist one, if by
that one means an era governed by metropolitan sensibilities.",

"Rather, the point to bear in mind is that the anti-industrial 
stance of a Ruskin or an Arnold was itself a politically engaged one
Nor do the chapters on the Victorian era assume its culture was 
unified and monolithic or its economic development geographically
even. Internal divisions were plain to see in the public
hand-wringing over the condition-of England.",

"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have 
returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
lost himself,and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night.",

"When she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he came
home, the lad was spoilt as if he were a prince. His mother stuffed
him with jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and, playing
the philosopher, even said he might as well go about quite naked
like the young of animals.",

"How long a period elapsed between the foundation of London and the
arrival of the Romans? How long between the foundation and the 
beginnings of trade? It is quite impossible even to guess. When 
Cesar landed Gauls and Belgians were already here before him. As for
the Britons themselves they were Celts, as were the Gauls and the
Belgians, but of what is called the Brythonic branch.",

"A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him
more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbad the
indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither 
behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present.",

"having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing 
against herself, for this curious child was very fond of 
pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now, thought poor
Alice, to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough 
of me left to make ONE respectable person!.",

"When the Romans came they found the town prosperous. That is all we
know. What the town was like we do not know. It is, however probable
that the requirements of trade had already necessitated some form of
embankment and some kind of quay; also, if trade were of long 
standing, some improvement in the huts, the manner of living.",

"had enough of restaurants and theatres and racemeetings. I had
no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Plenty
of people invited me to their houses, but they didn't seem much 
interested in me.They would fling me a question or two about South
Africa, and then get on their own affairs.",

"From all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show; and he 
played a straight game too, which was more than could be said for 
most of them. I gathered that they hated him pretty blackly in 
Berlin and Vienna, but that we were going to stick by him.",

"'I can offer you no consolation, my friend,' said he; your disaster
is irreparable. What do you intend to do? To go instantly to Geneva
come with me, Henry, to order the horses. During our walk, Clerval 
endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express
his heartfelt sympathy. Poor William! said he, dear lovely child.",

"in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot 
stove. On the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close 
streets are empty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock 
at the doors, he opened his window and leaned out. The river, that
makes of this quarter of Rouen a wretched little Venice. ",

"My flat was the first floor in a new block behind Langham Place.
There was a common staircase, with a porter and a liftman at the 
entrance, but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and
each flat was quite shut off from the others. I hate servants on the
premises,so I had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day.",

"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking! Just then her head struck 
against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine 
feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried
off to the garden door.",

"We know what happened with other cities. Anderida, now called 
Pevensey, was taken by the Saxons, and all its inhabitants, man, 
woman and child, were slaughtered, so that it became a waste until
the Normans built a castle within the old walls. Canterbury, 
Silchester, Porchester, Colchester-all were taken, their people
massacred, the walls left standing, the streets left desolate.",

"I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the
threshold than he made a dash for my back room, where I used to 
smoke and write my letters.Then he bolted back. Is the door locked? 
he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.",

"loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town,
I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of 
feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar
to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How 
altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and 
desolating change had taken place.",

"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance,
and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the 
White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid
gloves in one hand and large fan in the other: he came trotting 
along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came.",

"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. 
I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm
and the snowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed. By
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my 
journey towards Geneva.",

"What sort of defence were the people likely to offer? For nearly 
four hundred years they had lived at peace, free to grow rich and
luxurious, with mercenaries to fight for them. Between the taking
of the City by Boadicea and the departure of the Romans, a space 
of three hundred and fifty years, the peace of the City was only 
disturbed by the lawlessness of Allectus's mercenaries.",

"A smile flickered over his drawn face. I'm not mad -yet. Say, 
Sir, I've been watching you, and I reckon you're a cool customer. 
I reckon, too, you're an honest man, and not afraid of playing a
bold hand. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any
man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in. Get
on with your yarn,' I said, 'and I'll tell you.",

"Let me say again: today for me it is an impossible book .I call 
it something poorly written, ponderous, embarrassing, with fantastic
and confused imagery, sentimental, here and there so saccharine it 
is effeminate, uneven in tempo, without any impulse for logical
clarity, extremely self-confident and thus dispensing with evidence,
even distrustful of the relevance of evidence.",

"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the 
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of 
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit 
with pink eyes ran close by her.",

"Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. 
Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark
mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a 
vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was
destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I
prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance.",

"that beside them there were financiers who were playing for 
money. A clever man can make big profits on a falling market, 
and it suited the book of both classes to set Europe by the ears.
He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had puzzled
me things that happened in the Balkan War, how one state suddenly
came out on top, why alliances were made and broken.",

"Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he 
engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that
time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding
objects. She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she
liked him for it. He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind
by ill-timed conversation.",

"it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit 
hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, 
never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",

"Besides, with cheek a man always gets on in the world. Madame bit
her lips, and the child knocked about the village. He went after 
the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens that were
flying about. He ate blackberries along  the hedges minded the geese
with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran about in the 
woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days.",

"One more point may be made out from history. Since London was a 
town which then, as now, lived entirely by its trade and was the 
centre of the export and import trade of the whole country, the 
merchants, as we have seen, must have suffered most severely long
before the Romans went away. We are, therefore, in the year 410,
facing a situation full of menace.",

"I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling
on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of 
comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country
my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in 
again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy
lovely lake!",

"name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New 
Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke 
fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think
you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll 
think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall 
see it written up somewhere.",

"the first man you meet is Prince von und Zu Something, an elegant
young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English. But he cuts no ice. If
your business is big, you get behind him and find a prognathous
Westphalian with a retreating brow and the manners of a hog. He is 
the German business man that gives your English papers the shakes.",

"But if you're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to 
the real boss, ten to one you are brought up against a little white 
faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, Sir,
he is the man who is ruling the world just now, and he has his knife
in the Empire of the Tzar, because his aunt was outraged and his
father flogged in some one-horse location on the Volga.",

"The preface to Richard Wagner already proposed that art and not
morality was the essential metaphysical human activity; in the book
itself there appears many times over the suggestive statement that 
the existence of the world is justified only as an aesthetic 
phenomenon.",

"In fact, the entire book recognizes only an artist's sense and a 
deeper meaning under everything that happens a God,'if you will, but
certainly only a totally unthinking and amoral artist-God, who in 
creation as in destruction, in good things as in bad, desires to
become aware of his own pleasures and autocratic power equally.",

"ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.
He soon reached the summit, and disappeared. I remained motionless. 
The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was 
enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I resolved in my minds the 
events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of 
my progress toward the creation.",

"those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man
whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must
enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must 
charm us both. Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's 
manner in reading to us last night!.",

"occasions, when Monsieur le Cure, on his way back after 
administering the viaticum to some sick person in the neighbourhood,
caught sight of Charles playing about the fields, he called him, 
lectured him for a quarter of an hour and took advantage of the 
occasion to make him conjugate his verb at the foot of a tree. The 
rain interrupted them or an acquaintance passed.",

"A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound of a 
bell. Here, the evening prayer. Charles could not go on like this.
Madame Bovary took strong steps. Ashamed, or rather tired out, 
Monsieur Bovary gave in without a struggle, and they waited one
year longer, so that the lad should take his first communion.",

"No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of
the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did 
not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy 
in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had 
cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect
purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done.",

"I could not help saying that his Jew-anarchists seemed to have got
left behind a little.'Yes and no,' he said. 'They won up to a point, 
but they struck a bigger thing than money, a thing that couldn't be 
bought, the old elemental fighting instincts of man. If you're going
to be killed you invent some kind of flag and country to fight for, 
and if you survive you get to love the thing.",

"their sleeves, and unless I can keep alive for a month they are
going to play it and win. But I thought you were dead, I put in. 
'Mors janua vitae', he smiled. (I recognized the quotation: it was
about all the Latin I knew.) I'm coming to that, but I've got to
put you wise about a lot of things first. If you read your newspaper
I guess you know the name of Constantine Karolides?.",

"thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark
overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit
was still in sight, hurrying down it.",

"Do people understand the nature of the task I dared to touch on 
back then with this book? How much I now regret the fact that at 
the time I did not yet have the courage or the presumptuousness?
to allow myself in every respect a personal language for such an
individual point of view and such daring exploits.",

"We will have achieved much for scientific study of aesthetics when
we come, not merely to a logical understanding, but also to the 
certain and immediate apprehension of the fact that the further
development of art is bound up with the duality of the Apollonian
and the Dionysian, just as reproduction similarly depends upon the
duality of the sexes.",

"Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally
sent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the 
end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair. It would now be
impossible for any of us to remember anything about him.",

"What about the British Government? I said. They're not going to let
